<H1>The debugger (camldebug)</H1>
 <A name="c:debugger"></A><P>
This chapter describes the Caml Light source-level replay debugger
<tt>camldebug</tt>.<P>
<dl><dt><b>Unix:</b><dd> The debugger resides in the directory <tt>contrib/debugger</tt>
in the distribution. It requires a Unix system that provides BSD sockets.
</dl><P>
<dl><dt><b>Mac:</b><dd> The debugger is not available. </dl><P>
<dl><dt><b>PC:</b><dd> The debugger is not available. </dl><P>
<H2>Compiling for debugging</H2>
<P>
Before the debugger can be used, the program must be compiled and
linked with the <tt>-g</tt> option: all <tt>.zo</tt> files that are part of the
program should have been created with <tt>camlc -g</tt>, and they must be
linked together with <tt>camlc -g</tt>.<P>
Compiling with <tt>-g</tt> entails no penalty on the running time of
programs: <tt>.zo</tt> files and bytecode executable files are bigger and
take slightly longer to produce, but the executable files run at
exactly the same speed as if they had been compiled without <tt>-g</tt>. It
is therefore perfectly acceptable to compile always in <tt>-g</tt> mode.<P>
<H2>Invocation</H2>
<P>
<H3>Starting the debugger</H3>
<P>
The Caml Light debugger is invoked by running the program
<tt>camldebug</tt> with the name of the bytecode executable file as argument:
<pre>
        camldebug <i>program</i>
</pre>
The following command-line options are recognized:
<p><dl>
<dt><tt>-stdlib </tt><i>directory</i><dd>
Look for the standard library files in <i>directory</i> instead of in
the default directory.<P>
<dt><tt>-s </tt><i>socket</i><dd>
Use <i>socket</i> for communicating with the debugged program. See the
description of the command <tt>set socket</tt> (section <A HREF="node10.html#s:communication">10.8</A>)
for the format of <i>socket</i>.<P>
<dt><tt>-c </tt> <i>count</i><dd>
Set the maximum number of checkpoints to <i>count</i>.<P>
<dt><tt>-cd </tt> <i>directory</i><dd>
Run the debugger program from the working directory <i>directory</i>,
instead of the current directory.<P>
<dt><tt>-emacs</tt><dd>
Tell the debugger it is executing under Emacs. (See
section <A HREF="node12.html#s:inf-debugger">12.4</A> for information on how to run the
debugger under Emacs.)
</dl><P>
<H3>Quitting the debugger</H3>
<P>
The command <tt>quit</tt> exits the debugger. You can also exit the debugger
by typing an end-of-file character (usually <tt>ctrl-D</tt>).<P>
Typing an interrupt character (usually <tt>ctrl-C</tt>) will not exit the
debugger, but will terminate the action of any debugger command that is in
progress and return to the debugger command level. <P>
<H2>Commands</H2>
 <A name="s:debugger-commands"></A><P>
A debugger command is a single line of input. It starts with a command
name, which is followed by arguments depending on this name. Examples:
<pre>
        run
        goto 1000
        set arguments arg1 arg2
</pre><P>
A command name can be truncated as long as there is no ambiguity. For
instance, <tt>go 1000</tt> is understood as <tt>goto 1000</tt>, since there are no
other commands whose name starts with <tt>go</tt>. For the most frequently
used commands, ambiguous abbreviations are allowed. For instance, <tt>r</tt>
stands for <tt>run</tt> even though there are others commands starting with
<tt>r</tt>. You can test the validity of an abbreviation using the <tt>help</tt> command.<P>
If the previous command has been successful, a blank line (typing just
<tt>RET</tt>) will repeat it.<P>
<H3>Getting help</H3>
<P>
The Caml Light debugger has a simple on-line help system, which gives
a brief description of each command and variable.<P>
<p><dl>
<dt><tt>help</tt><dd>
Print the list of commands.<P>
<dt><tt>help </tt><i>command</i><dd>
Give help about the command <i>command</i>.<P>
<dt><tt>help set </tt><i>variable</i>, <tt>help show </tt><i>variable</i><dd>
Give help about the variable <i>variable</i>. The list of all debugger
variables can be obtained with <tt>help set</tt>.<P>
<dt><tt>help info </tt><i>topic</i><dd>
Give help about <i>topic</i>. Use <tt>help info</tt> to get a list of known topics.
</dl><P>
<H3>Accessing the debugger state</H3>
<P>
<p><dl>
<dt><tt>set </tt><i>variable</i> <i>value</i><dd>
Set the debugger variable <i>variable</i> to the value <i>value</i>.<P>
<dt><tt>show </tt><i>variable</i><dd>
Print the value of the debugger variable <i>variable</i>.<P>
<dt><tt>info </tt><i>subject</i><dd>
Give information about the given subject.
For instance, <tt>info breakpoints</tt> will print the list of all breakpoints.
</dl><P>
<H2>Executing a program</H2>
<P>
<H3>Events</H3>
<P>
Events are ``interesting'' locations in the source code, corresponding
to the beginning or end of evaluation of ``interesting''
sub-expressions. Events are the unit of single-stepping (stepping goes
to the next or previous event encountered in the program execution).
Also, breakpoints can only be set at events. Thus, events play the
role of line numbers in debuggers for conventional languages.<P>
During program execution, a counter is incremented at each event
encountered. The value of this counter is referred as the <i>current
time</i>. Thanks to reverse execution, it is possible to jump back and
forth to any time of the execution.<P>
Here is where the debugger events (written ¤) are located in
the source code:
<p><ul>
<li> Following a function application:
<pre>
(f arg)¤
</pre>
<li> After receiving an argument to a function:
<pre>
fun x¤ y¤ z -&gt; ¤ ...
</pre>
If a curried function is defined by pattern-matching with several
cases, events corresponding to the passing of arguments are displayed
on the first case of the function, because pattern-matching has not
yet determined which case to select:
<pre>
fun pat1¤ pat2¤ pat3 -&gt; ¤ ...
  | ...
</pre>
<li> On each case of a pattern-matching definition (function,
<tt>match</tt>...<tt>with</tt> construct, <tt>try</tt>...<tt>with</tt> construct):
<pre>
function pat1 -&gt; ¤ expr1
       | ...
       | patN -&gt; ¤ exprN
</pre>
<li> Between subexpressions of a sequence:
<pre>
expr1; ¤ expr2; ¤ ...; ¤ exprN
</pre>
<li> In the two branches of a conditional expression:
<pre>
if cond then ¤ expr1 else ¤ expr2
</pre>
<li> At the beginning of each iteration of a loop:
<pre>
while cond do ¤ body done
for i = a to b do ¤ body done
</pre>
</ul>
Exceptions: A function application followed by a function return is replaced
by the compiler by a jump (tail-call optimization). In this case, no
event is put after the function application. Also, no event is put
after a function application when the function is a primitive function
(written in C). Finally, several events may correspond to the same
location in the compiled program. Then, the debugger cannot
distinguish them, and selects one of the events to associate with the
given code location.  The event chosen is a ``function application''
event if there is one at that location, or otherwise the event which
appears last in the source. This heuristic generally picks the ``most
interesting'' event associated with the code location.<P>
<H3>Starting the debugged program</H3>
<P>
The debugger starts executing the debugged program only when needed.
This allows setting breapoints or assigning debugger variables before
execution starts. There are several ways to start execution:
<p><dl>
<dt><tt>run</tt><dd> Run the program until a breakpoint is hit, or the program
terminates.
<dt><tt>step 0</tt><dd> Load the program and stop on the first event.
<dt><tt>goto </tt><i>time</i><dd> Load the program and execute it until the
given time. Useful when you already know approximately at what time
the problem appears. Also useful to set breakpoints on function values
that have not been computed at time 0 (see section <A HREF="node10.html#s:breakpoints">10.5</A>).
</dl><P>
The execution of a program is affected by certain information it
receives when the debugger starts it, such as the command-line
arguments to the program and its working directory. The debugger
provides commands to specify this information (<tt>set arguments</tt> and <tt>cd</tt>).
These commands must be used before program execution starts. If you try
to change the arguments or the working directory after starting your
program, the debugger will kill the program (after asking for confirmation).<P>
<H3>Running the program</H3>
<P>
The following commands execute the program forward or backward,
starting at the current time. The execution will stop either when
specified by the command or when a breakpoint is encountered.<P>
<p><dl>
<dt><tt>run</tt><dd> Execute the program forward from current time. Stops at
next breakpoint or when the program terminates.
<dt><tt>reverse</tt><dd> Execute the program backward from current time.
Mostly useful to go to the last breakpoint encountered before the
current time.
<dt><tt>step </tt>[<i>count</i>]<dd> Run the program and stop at the next event. With
an argument, do it <i>count</i> times.
<dt><tt>backstep </tt>[<i>count</i>]<dd> Run the program backward and stop at
the previous event. With an argument, do it <i>count</i> times.
<dt><tt>next </tt>[<i>count</i>]<dd> Run the program and stop at the next
event, skipping over function calls. With an argument, do it
<i>count</i> times.
<dt><tt>finish</tt><dd> Run the program until the current function returns.
</dl><P>
<H3>Time travel</H3>
<P>
You can jump directly to a given time, without stopping on
breakpoints, using the <tt>goto</tt> command.<P>
As you move through the program, the debugger maintains an history of
the successive times you stop at. The <tt>last</tt> command can be used to
revisit these times: each <tt>last</tt> command moves one step back through
the history. That is useful mainly to undo commands such as <tt>step</tt>
and <tt>next</tt>.<P>
<p><dl>
<dt><tt>goto </tt><i>time</i><dd>
Jump to the given time.
<dt><tt>last </tt>[<i>count</i>]<dd>
Go back to the latest time recorded in the execution history. With an
argument, do it <i>count</i> times.
<dt><tt>set history </tt><i>size</i><dd>
Set the size of the execution history.
</dl><P>
<H3>Killing the program</H3>
<P>
<p><dl>
<dt><tt>kill</tt><dd> Kill the program being executed. This command is mainly
useful if you wish to recompile the program without leaving the debugger.
</dl><P>
<H2>Breakpoints</H2>
 <A name="s:breakpoints"></A><P>
A breakpoint causes the program to stop whenever a certain point in
the program is reached. It can be set in several ways using the
<tt>break</tt> command. Breakpoints are assigned numbers when set, for
further reference.<P>
<p><dl>
<dt><tt>break</tt><dd>
Set a breakpoint at the current position in the program execution. The
current position must be on an event (i.e., neither at the beginning,
nor at the end of the program).<P>
<dt><tt>break </tt><i>function</i><dd>
Set a breakpoint at the beginning of <i>function</i>. This works only
when the functional value of the identifier <i>function</i> has been
computed and assigned to the identifier. Hence this command cannot be
used at the very beginning of the program execution, when all
identifiers are still undefined. Moreover, C functions are not
recognized by the debugger.<P>
<dt><tt>break @</tt> [<i>module</i>] <i>line</i><dd>
Set a breakpoint in module <i>module</i> (or in the current module if
<i>module</i> is not given), at the first event of line <i>line</i>.<P>
<dt><tt>break @</tt> [<i>module</i>] <i>line</i> <i>column</i><dd>
Set a breakpoint in module <i>module</i> (or in the current module if
<i>module</i> is not given), at the event closest to line <i>line</i>,
column <i>column</i>.<P>
<dt><tt>break @</tt> [<i>module</i>] <tt>#</tt> <i>character</i><dd>
Set a breakpoint in module <i>module</i> at the event closest to
character number <i>character</i>.<P>
<dt><tt>break </tt><i>address</i><dd>
Set a breakpoint at the code address <i>address</i>.<P>
<dt><tt>delete </tt>[<i>breakpoint-numbers</i>]<dd>
Delete the specified breakpoints. Without argument, all breakpoints
are deleted (after asking for confirmation).<P>
<dt><tt>info breakpoints</tt><dd> Print the list of all breakpoints.
</dl><P>
<H2>The call stack</H2>
<P>
Each time the program performs a function application, it saves the
location of the application (the return address) in a block of data
called a stack frame. The frame also contains the local variables of
the caller function. All the frames are allocated in a region of
memory called the call stack. The command <tt>backtrace</tt> (or <tt>bt</tt>)
displays parts of the call stack.<P>
At any time, one of the stack frames is ``selected'' by the debugger; several
debugger commands refer implicitly to the selected frame. In particular,
whenever you ask the debugger for the value of a local variable, the
value is found in the selected frame. The commands <tt>frame</tt>, <tt>up</tt> and <tt>down</tt>
select whichever frame you are interested in.<P>
When the program stops, the debugger automatically selects the
currently executing frame and describes it briefly as the <tt>frame</tt>
command does.<P>
<p><dl>
<dt><tt>frame</tt><dd>
Describe the currently selected stack frame.<P>
<dt><tt>frame</tt> <i>frame-number</i><dd>
Select a stack frame by number and describe it. The frame currently
executing when the program stopped has number 0; its caller has number
1; and so on up the call stack.<P>
<dt><tt>backtrace </tt>[<i>count</i>], <tt>bt </tt>[<i>count</i>]<dd>
Print the call stack. This is useful to see which sequence of function
calls led to the currently executing frame. With a positive argument,
print only the innermost <i>count</i> frames.
With a negative argument, print only the outermost -<i>count</i> frames.<P>
<dt><tt>up</tt> [<i>count</i>]<dd>
Select and display the stack frame just ``above'' the selected frame,
that is, the frame that called the selected frame. An argument says how
many frames to go up.<P>
<dt><tt>down </tt>[<i>count</i>]<dd>
Select and display the stack frame just ``below'' the selected frame,
that is, the frame that was called by the selected frame. An argument
says how many frames to go down.
</dl><P>
<H2>Examining variable values</H2>
<P>
The debugger can print the current value of a program variable (either
a global variable or a local variable relative to the selected stack
frame). It can also print selected parts of a value by matching it
against a pattern.<P>
Variable names can be specified either fully qualified
(<i>module-name</i><tt>__</tt><i>var-name</i>) or unqualified
(<i>var-name</i>). Unqualified names either correspond to local
variables, or are completed into fully qualified global names
by looking at a list of ``opened'' modules that define the same name
(see section <A HREF="node10.html#s:debugger-open">10.8</A> for how to open modules in the debugger.)
The completion follows the same rules as in the Caml Light language
(see section <A HREF="node3.3.html#s:names">3.3</A>).<P>
<p><dl>
<dt><tt>print </tt><i>variables</i><dd>
Print the values of the given variables.
<dt><tt>match </tt><i>variable</i> <i>pattern</i><dd>
Match the value of the given variable against a pattern, and print the
values bound to the identifiers in the pattern.
</dl><P>
The syntax of patterns for the <tt>match</tt> command extends the one for
Caml Light patterns:<P>

<PRE>
<i>pattern</i>:
      <i>ident</i>
   |  <font color="blue"><code>_</code></font>
   |  <font color="blue"><code>(</code></font> <i>pattern</i> <font color="blue"><code>)</code></font>
   |  <i>ncconstr</i> <i>pattern</i>
   |  <i>pattern</i> <font color="blue"><code>,</code></font> <i>pattern</i> <i>{</i><font color="blue"><code>,</code></font> <i>pattern</i><i>}</i>
   |  <font color="blue"><code>{</code></font> <i>label</i> <font color="blue"><code>=</code></font> <i>pattern</i> <i>{</i><font color="blue"><code>;</code></font> <i>label</i> <font color="blue"><code>=</code></font> <i>pattern</i><i>}</i> <font color="blue"><code>}</code></font>
   |  <font color="blue"><code>[</code></font> <font color="blue"><code>]</code></font>
   |  <font color="blue"><code>[</code></font> <i>pattern</i> <i>{</i><font color="blue"><code>;</code></font> <i>pattern</i><i>}</i> <font color="blue"><code>]</code></font>
   |  <i>pattern</i> <font color="blue"><code>::</code></font> <i>pattern</i>
   |  <font color="blue"><code>#</code></font> <i>integer-literal</i> <i>pattern</i>
   |  <font color="blue"><code>&gt;</code></font> <i>pattern</i></PRE>
<P>
The pattern <i>ident</i>, where <i>ident</i> is an identifier, matches any
value, and binds the identifier to this value. The pattern
<font color="blue"><code>#</code></font> <i>n</i> <i>pattern</i> matches a list, a vector or a tuple whose <i>n</i>-th
element matches <i>pattern</i>.
The pattern <font color="blue"><code>&gt;</code></font> <i>pattern</i> matches any
constructed value whose argument matches <i>pattern</i>, regardless of the
constructor; it is a shortcut for skipping a constructor.<P>
Example: assuming the value of <tt>a</tt> is <tt>Constr{x = [1;2;3;4]}</tt>,
the command <tt>match a &gt; {x = # 2 k}</tt> prints <tt>k = 3</tt>.<P>
<p><dl>
<dt><tt>set print_depth</tt> <i>d</i><dd>
Limit the printing of values to a maximal depth of <i>d</i>. 
<dt><tt>set print_length</tt> <i>l</i><dd>
Limit the printing of values to at most <i>l</i> nodes printed.
</dl><P>
<H2>Controlling the debugger</H2>
<P>
<H3>Setting the program name and arguments</H3>
<P>
<p><dl>
<dt><tt>set program</tt> <i>file</i><dd>
Set the program name to <i>file</i>.
<dt><tt>set arguments</tt> <i>arguments</i><dd>
Give <i>arguments</i> as command-line arguments for the program.
</dl><P>
A shell is used to pass the arguments to the debugged program. You can
therefore use wildcards, shell variables, and file redirections inside
the arguments. To debug programs that read from standard input, it is
recommended to redirect their input from a file (using
<tt>set arguments &lt; input-file</tt>), otherwise input to the program and
input to the debugger are not properly separated.<P>
<H3>How programs are loaded</H3>
<P>
The <tt>loadingmode</tt> variable controls how the program is executed.<P>
<p><dl>
<dt><tt>set loadingmode direct</tt><dd>
The program is run directly by the debugger. This is the default mode.
<dt><tt>set loadingmode runtime</tt><dd>
The debugger execute the Caml Light runtime <tt>camlrun</tt> on the program.
Rarely useful; moreover it prevents the debugging of programs compiled
in ``custom runtime'' mode.
<dt><tt>set loadingmode manual</tt><dd>
The user starts manually the program, when asked by the debugger.
Allows remote debugging (see section <A HREF="node10.html#s:communication">10.8</A>).
</dl><P>
<H3>Search path for files</H3>
<P>
The debugger searches for source files and compiled interface files in
a list of directories, the search path. The search path initially
contains the current directory <tt>.</tt> and the standard library directory.
The <tt>directory</tt> command adds directories to the path.<P>
Whenever the search path is modified, the debugger will clear any
information it may have cached about the files.<P>
<p><dl>
<dt><tt>directory</tt> <i>directorynames</i><dd>
Add the given directories to the search path. These directories are
added at the front, and will therefore be searched first.<P>
<dt><tt>directory</tt><dd>
Reset the search path. This requires confirmation.
</dl><P>
<H3>Working directory</H3>
<P>
Each time a program is started in the debugger, it inherits its working
directory from the current working directory of the debugger.  This
working directory is initially whatever it inherited from its parent
process (typically the shell), but you can specify a new working
directory in the debugger with the <tt>cd</tt> command or the <tt>-cd</tt>
command-line option.<P>
<p><dl>
<dt><tt>cd</tt> <i>directory</i><dd>
Set the working directory for <tt>camldebug</tt> to <i>directory</i>.<P>
<dt><tt>pwd</tt><dd>
Print the working directory for <tt>camldebug</tt>.
</dl><P>
<H3>Module management</H3>
 <A name="s:debugger-open"></A><P>
Like the Caml Light compiler, the debugger maintains a list of opened
modules in order to resolves variable name ambiguities. The opened
modules also affect the printing of values: whether fully qualified
names or short names are used for constructors and record labels.<P>
When a program is executed, the debugger automatically opens the
modules of the standard library it uses.<P>
<p><dl>
<dt><tt>open</tt> <i>modules</i><dd>
Open the given modules.<P>
<dt><tt>close</tt> <i>modules</i><dd>
Close the given modules.<P>
<dt><tt>info modules</tt><dd>
List the modules used by the program, and the open modules.
</dl><P>
<H3>Turning reverse execution on and off</H3>
<P>
In some cases, you may want to turn reverse execution off. This speeds
up the program execution, and is also sometimes useful for interactive
programs. <P>
Normally, the debugger takes checkpoints of the program state from
time to time. That is, it makes a copy of the current state of the
program (using the Unix system call <tt>fork</tt>). If the variable
<i>checkpoints</i> is set to <tt>off</tt>, the debugger will not take any
checkpoints.<P>
<p><dl>
<dt><tt>set checkpoints</tt> <i>on/off</i><dd>
Select whether the debugger makes checkpoints or not.
</dl><P>
<H3>Communication between the debugger and the program</H3>

<A name="s:communication"></A><P>
The debugger communicate with the program being debugged through a
Unix socket. You may need to change the socket name, for example if
you need to run the debugger on a machine and your program on another.<P>
<p><dl>
<dt><tt>set socket</tt> <i>socket</i><dd>
Use <i>socket</i> for communication with the program. <i>socket</i> can be
either a file name, or an Internet port specification
<i>host</i>:<i>port</i>, where <i>host</i> is a host name or an Internet
address in dot notation, and <i>port</i> is a port number on the host.
</dl><P>
On the debugged program side, the socket name is passed either by the
<tt>-D</tt> command line option to <tt>camlrun</tt>, or through the
<tt>CAML_DEBUG_SOCKET</tt> environment variable.<P>
<H3>Fine-tuning the debugger</H3>
 <A name="s:fine-tuning"></A><P>
Several variables enables to fine-tune the debugger. Reasonable
defaults are provided, and you should normally not have to change them.<P>
<p><dl>
<dt><tt>set processcount</tt> <i>count</i><dd>
Set the maximum number of checkpoints to <i>count</i>. More checkpoints
facilitate going far back in time, but use more memory and create more
Unix processes.
</dl><P>
As checkpointing is quite expensive, it must not be done too often. On
the other hand, backward execution is faster when checkpoints are
taken more often. In particular, backward single-stepping is more
responsive when many checkpoints have been taken just before the
current time. To fine-tune the checkpointing strategy, the debugger
does not take checkpoints at the same frequency for long displacements
(e.g. <tt>run</tt>) and small ones (e.g. <tt>step</tt>). The two variables <tt>bigstep</tt>
and <tt>smallstep</tt> contain the number of events between two checkpoints
in each case.<P>
<p><dl>
<dt><tt>set bigstep</tt> <i>count</i><dd>
Set the number of events between two checkpoints for long displacements.
<dt><tt>set smallstep</tt> <i>count</i><dd>
Set the number of events between two checkpoints for small
displacements.
</dl><P>
The following commands display information on checkpoints and events:<P>
<p><dl>
<dt><tt>info checkpoints</tt><dd>
Print a list of checkpoints.
<dt><tt>info events</tt> [<i>module</i>]<dd>
Print the list of events in the given module (the current module, by default).
</dl><P>
<H2>Miscellaneous commands</H2>
<P>
<p><dl>
<dt><tt>list</tt> [<i>module</i>] [<i>beginning</i>] [<i>end</i>]<dd>
List the source of module <i>module</i>, from line number
<i>beginning</i> to line number <i>end</i>. By default, 20 lines of the
current module are displayed, starting 10 lines before the current
position.
<dt><tt>source</tt> <i>filename</i><dd>
Read debugger commands from the script <i>filename</i>.
